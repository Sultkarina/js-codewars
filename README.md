Задание 36.

You should return the original string, but with any stray hairs removed. Keep count ot them though, as there is a second element you need to return:

0 hairs --> "Clean!"
1 hair --> "Unicorn!"
2 hairs --> "Homer!"
3-5 hairs --> "Careless!"
>5 hairs --> "Hobo!"

So for this head: "------/------" you shoud return:

["-------------", "Unicorn"]
